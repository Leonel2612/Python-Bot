# Python-Bot
These scripts consist of two components:
1. The "pc_game" script features a conversational bot that can engage in simple conversations with users. To interact with the bot, simply run the script and ensure your microphone is enabled.

2. The second script features a bot designed to assist users in purchasing items from web pages. This bot monitors the availability of desired products and notifies users when those items become available for purchase.

With those scripts, users can experience the convenience of conversing with a bot and leverage its capabilities to streamline their online shopping experience.
